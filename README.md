# Smile Centers

## Description

Smile Centers is a web application built under the layered architectural software pattern.

The [presentation layer](https://github.com/saesbuba/smile-centers/tree/main/presentation-layer) is developed with the [React](https://react.dev/) library, while the [business layer](https://github.com/saesbuba/smile-centers/tree/main/business-layer) is built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and finally data persistence is managed by a log file.

The business layer provides a [service](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/saesbuba/Smile_Centers_API/1.0) exposed through an URL, the client or the presentation layer can communicate with these services through the HTTP protocol to obtain the necessary resources or services.
